Python file hashing utility

It doesn't do anything useful yet, but one day when I get some more time, it
will then do something useful.

Scoring
=====================
  Required (100)
  -------------
    * Recurses files from path given on commandline
    * Hashes file contents to md5
    * Gives intuitive output linking filename to hash
    * Git commit history shows at least one commit from each team member

  Bonus
  --------------
    * (5) File/folder exclusion support
    * (5) File/folder exclusion by wildcards
    * (10) Support configurable hash algorithms
    * (5) Support multiple output encodings (base64, hex, etc.)
    * (5) Support output types (stdout, file, xml, etc.)
    * (5) Output other file information (file-size, modify-time, etc.)
    * (5) Show progress in console
    * (5) Verify single file with known hash
    * (10) Write a generator function
    * (10) Pass a function as an argument

  Next-step
  --------------
    * (50) Reading from output file to compare against files on disk
    * (10) Read from a standard hash file, autodetect hashtype (.md5sum)
